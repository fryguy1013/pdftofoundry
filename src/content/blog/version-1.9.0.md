Version 1.9.0 is now out.

New in this version is support for the new content Paizo released in March and April: Abomination Vaults 3 and PFS scenarios 2-15, 2-16, 2-17 and 2-18. There were some significant improvements to the stat-block parsing engine as it was used as the basis for the Bestiary 3 compendium in the PF2E system (with a lot of manual tweaks).

I apologize that it's taken a long time for this release to come out.
