Apparently Paizo just [released a new one-shot adventure](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shll?Introducing-Paizo-OneShots) and they said Fantasy Grounds is the only VTT to have support for it on the first day. I needed to prove them wrong, so here is a quick 1.8.1 release which includes support for the new adventure.

A note about the import process though. This adventure comes as a zip file which includes the maps/journal images standalone as jpgs. Unfortunately, there isn't support for importing these images (yet) so you'll have to upload them yourself. For the scene you should be able to just update the image and the walls/journals should still be correctly aligned.
