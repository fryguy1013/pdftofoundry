Version 2.1.0 is now out.

New in this version is support for the new content Paizo released in July:

* Adventure Path modules Fists of the Ruby Phoenix #1, #2, and #3
* Standalone adventure Malevolence
* PFS scenarios 2-21, 2-22, 2-23, and 2-24

Additionally, this release works around a few bugs in Foundry 0.8, mostly to do with sorting the documents created by the importer. There are lots of additional behind the scenes work to improve my workflow in adding support for adventures as well.

This release took a bit longer than usual due to it being 3 APs a standalone adventure all released at the same time. It's the biggest release I've Ever Given.
