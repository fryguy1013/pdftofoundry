Version 3.2.0 is out now.

This is primarily a content update. The following are the new content for this release:

* Quest for the Frozen Flame #1 - Broken Tusk Moon
* Pathfinder Society Season 3-08 - Foundation's Price
* Pathfinder Society Season 3-09 - The Secluded Siege
* Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide - NPC Gallery tokenized

Additionally, there were some core improvements to the PDF parsing to allow the interactive maps, which hopefully shouldn't cause any issues in older modules. Along with this are a few issues that were reported in the gitlab.
