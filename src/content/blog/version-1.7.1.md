Version 1.7.1, a mid-month update, is now released.

The main content added in this is updating Abomination Vaults 1 to support the re-released PDFs. If you try to import the previously released PDF you will need to download the latest version from Paizo.

Also in this version is the improved workflow for importing Flip Mats/Interactive Maps for the scenarios that include higher-resolution maps in them. Now simply import the main PDF and then when you import the interactive map and/or flip mat it will update the scenes with the walls/journals with the higher quality map. It should also work in the other order but that workflow hasn't been tested as well.

I made a video demonstration here:
