Version 3.1.0 is out now.

New in this update is support for FoundryVTT v9. This is mostly working, except for a FoundryVTT v9 bug in which the token sizes aren't respected that I was unable to work around. So this means that a small token might appear as medium until you open the token's sheet and close it.

The following are the new content for this release:

* Pathfinder Society Season 3-06 - Struck by Shadows
* Pathfinder Society Season 3-07 - Locked Lodge
* Bounty #16: Boom Town Betrayal
* Bounty #17: Sodden Stories
* RPG Day Adventure: Threshold of Knowledge
