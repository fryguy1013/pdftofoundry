Version 3.3.0 is out now.

This is primarily a content update. The following are the new content for this release:

* Quest for the Frozen Flame #2 - Lost Mammoth Valley
* Quest for the Frozen Flame #3 - Burning Tundra
* Strength of Thousands #6 - Shadows of the Ancients
* Pathfinder Society Season 3-10 - Delve the Pallid Depths
* Pathfinder Society Season 3-11 - No Time for Treason

A little bit disappointingly, the Interactive Maps in the QftFF adventures and the final Strength of Thousands adventure are not high quality like the previous interactive maps. They are the same quality as the ones in the main PDF much like Age of Ashes and Extinction Curse before [Paizo announced they would have higher quality digital maps available](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shcy?Changes-to-Digital-Map-Assets).

Additionally, I fixed an issue where upon completion of the import the sidebar would move to the center of the screen, as well as several of the bestiary 1 images being assigned to the wrong creature.

As some of you might have noticed, I missed the February content release with QftFF #2. I'd love to say that this was due to hex grids in Foundry ruining my life due to having to rewrite how the hex map import code works 3 times, at least once during each release of QftFF (and likely once more when Foundry VTT fixes the behavior in v10). But ultimately, updating PDF to Foundry has felt more like an obligation to the community than something I was doing for fun anymore. With each new feature that's been added (interactive maps, token creation, token placement, etc), the amount of time each pdf takes to prepare has increased significantly.

Ultimately, PDF to Foundry was, and always has been, a temporary solution. Due to how it works by being a script that pulls data out of the PDF with a set of instructions that were pre-programmed in, it is nearly impossible to be as high quality as something that has been adapted for a virtual tabletop directly. There are lots of weird PDF layout issues that make it much more difficult to programmatically change than going into the output text field and manually editing it and redistributing the output. I really didn't expect to be maintaining this project for two years. I mainly created it because I was running Age of Ashes and thought it would be easier to automate it than manually doing the work ([xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1319/)). I've done the work to add the rest mainly for the community's benefit and not my own.

Due to this, Quest for the Frozen Flame is the last Paizo Adventure Path I am committing to add to PDF to Foundry. I will likely continue adding PFS scenarios as they only take an hour or so to add but don't guarantee this. And I will definitely update it for new Foundry versions or if there are any major updates that break things. PDF to Foundry will mostly be in maintenance mode and no major features will be added. If you were planning on purchasing any future Adventure Path PDFs solely due to planning on importing them with PDF to Foundry, I urge you to reconsider.

I really want to thank my patrons and anyone who has purchased the content for me to add, and the overall generosity of the community. Nobody has been charged for March or April, and I will be unpublishing my Patreon page this month so that nobody gets charged again.
