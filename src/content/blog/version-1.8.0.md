Version 1.8.0 is now out.

New in this version is support for the new content Paizo released in February: Abomination Vaults 2 and PFS scenarios 2-12, 2-13, and 2-14. Some other minor tweaks like making the alert that the import is complete only visible to the person that imported the pdf and fixing some parsing of lists so they should show up as lists now.
