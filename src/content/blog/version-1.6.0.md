I just released the 1.6.0 version of PDF to foundry. New in this version are:

* Agents of Edgewatch #6 - Ruins of the Radiant Siege
* Troubles in Otari
* Menace Under Otari (Beginner Box adventure. The maps in the pdf kind of suck, so I recommend replacing them with the flip-mat version manually)
* PFS 2-09 Seven Secrets of Dacilane Academy
* PFS 2-10 In Burning Dawn

Additionally, there are the following improvements

* Images now save in webp instead of png, saving valuable space on your host and decreasing download times for loading scenes
* When the import is complete, a chat message is created so you don't have to watch over the progress bar
* Various fixes for missing text
