This is a quick and dirty script that lets you take pdfs that contain certain
adventures, and export them to a format that is compatible with Foundry Virtual
Tabletop for the Pathfinder 2nd edition system.

To use, follow the following steps:

* Download the module into your FoundryVTT instance on the setup page under modules. Either find It
  in the list of modules or paste in the following url as the manifest json:

  https://gitlab.com/fryguy1013/pdftofoundry/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/static_module/module.json?job=build

* In your world, go to the settings tab, under module settings find the PDF to
  Foundry module and enable it by clicking the checkbox.
* Go to the settings tab, and click the "Import PDF" button.
* Choose a PDF to import from your hard drive, and select the import option.
  Please be patient as it imports your PDF.
* You should now see the items from your PDF in your Foundry world.

It will not work with modified or pirated PDFs.
